We need to use webhook on Microsoft Teams if we want to send Azure Alert to Teams. Actually Azure has offered the option to send Azure Alert to webhook but Teams does not recognize the JSON template sent by Azure Alert. Therefore, we have to use a tool which receives and analyze data from Azure Alert, then send a template which Team could recoginize to Micorsoft Teams. We can either use logic app or automation runbook to achieve this goal. In this repository, I will guide you how to use automation runbook and I will show you a sample code. For the whole steps of sending Azure Alert to Teams, please refer to file StepToStepGuide.docx
